                    <p>Hi, I'm Gurvansh Singh Juneja — a photographer, visual storyteller, and creative soul who finds beauty in the unspoken moments. I believe that my photography isn't about perfection; but about presence.</p>
                    
                    <p>Over the years, I've curated hundreds of visuals that reflect not just the world around me, but how I feel about it — from the warmth of sleepy street dogs to the serenity of forgotten temples, from playful kittens to textured shadows.</p>
                    
                    <p>I'm currently pursuing a degree in tech but my heart beats for design, storytelling, and human connection — whether that's through photography, building immersive websites, or just sitting under a sky that's pink for no reason.</p>
                    
                    <p>This portfolio is a slice of how I see the world. I hope you see a bit of yourself in it too.</p>
